# System76RainbowKeys

Slight modification of Willian Wold's script here:  https://gitlab.com/wmww/kb_backlight/tree/master

My version does nothing but set the keyboard of a system76 PopOS machine to rainbow.  
Not tested for any other systems.

To get the result, simply cd into the "run" sub-directory and

sudo python po_po.py

The keys should go "rainbow" as you may have seen in pictures of your machine on the System76 website.
Thanks to William Wold for actually writing the script!

I just put it here in case it helps anyone get the result they want.  William's script makes the colors "hop around" before going back to normal.  Nothing wrong with that.   My simple change just fixes the colors as I had hoped for.

To switch back to the standard color variations, simply "Fn /" as is totally normal on your awesome machine.
I recommend staying multi-color and carry on with the sweet sweet coding.

Tested on an Oryx Pro 16" with Pop!_OS 19.04, 
python 2.7

Cheers,
Luke
